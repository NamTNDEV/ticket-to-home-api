**TicketToHome** is a high-performance API project built with **NestJS**, simulating the online sale of train tickets for **Lunar New Year** – one of the busiest and most emotional travel seasons of the year. Designed as a learning project, it focuses on real-world backend challenges like **massive traffic handling**, **database sharding**, and **search optimization** using **Elasticsearch**.

---

## 📚 Purpose

> This project is for **learning**, **experimenting**, and **growing** as a backend developer.

🎯 **Main goals:**

- Deepen knowledge of **NestJS** and backend architecture
- Practice building scalable APIs for high-demand events (like Black Friday or Tet)
- Explore **database design**, **performance bottlenecks**, and **search systems**
- Gain hands-on experience with tools like **Redis**, **Docker**, **Elasticsearch**
